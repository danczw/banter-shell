### ðŸ’¬ Intelligent Context Management

Keeping in mind the conversational nature of ChatGPT, Banter-Shell automatically saves the last six messages of your conversation. This allows the AI to take into account previous messages when formulating its responses, providing an impressively coherent and engaging chat experience.

### ðŸ”‘ Important Note Regarding API Keys

To utilize Banter-Shell, an API Key is needed. **Please note that the current version of Banter-Shell stores the API key in plain text** within the file `~/.bsh_profile`. As this approach may present potential security risks, we're advising all users to secure their API key properly and to be aware of where and how itâ€™s stored. We're already working on enhanced security features for future releases, so hang tight for those updates! Until then, happy chatting with Banter-Shell!
